## Our Vision

### "Define the industry standard for mobile application security."

We are writing a security standard for mobile apps and a comprehensive testing guide that covers the processes, techniques, and tools used during a mobile app security test, as well as an exhaustive set of test cases that enables testers to deliver consistent and complete results.

## Main Deliverables

### Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG)

![MSTG cover](assets/images/mstg-cover-release-small.jpg)

The MSTG is a comprehensive manual for mobile app security testing and reverse engineering for iOS and Android mobile security testers with the following content:

- Mobile platform internals
- Security testing in the mobile app development lifecycle
- Basic static and dynamic security testing
- Mobile app reverse engineering and tampering
- Assessing software protections
- Detailed test cases that map to the requirements in the MASVS.

You can contribute and comment in the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg). An online book version of the current master branch is available on [Gitbook](https://mobile-security.gitbook.io/mobile-security-testing-guide/).

Feel free to [download the ePub or Mobi](https://leanpub.com/mobile-security-testing-guide) for $0 or contribute any amount you like. All funds raised through sales of this book go directly into the project budget and will be used to for technical editing and designing the book and fund production of future releases.

### Mobile App Security Requirements and Verification

The OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) is a standard for mobile app security. It can be used by mobile software architects and developers seeking to develop secure mobile applications, as well as security testers to ensure completeness and consistency of test results.You can find the sources on the [Github repo](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs). We now have versions in the folllowing languages: Chinese, English, French, German, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish! Want to get a pdf/mobi/epub of the standard? Check the [release page](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/releases/) on Github.

### Mobile App Security Checklist
