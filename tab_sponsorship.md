## Why Sponsors?

As it turns out, writing a book to a professional standard is a challenging task, even more so if there's 50+ authors that aren't necessarily native speakers. Also, professional editors, graphic designers and layouters don't work for free. Thus, some funds are needed to make the tech book a reality.

100% of the funds raised go directly into the project budget and will be used to fund production of the final release, including:

Editing and proofreading by professional editors
Graphic design and layout
Any leftover funds will be donated to the OWASP Foundation to the mobile security project for future use.
